## Introduction
A tool for computing invariant polynomial potential energy surface fitting in computational chemistry. Invariants refer to Permutation Invariant Polynomials (PIP) and Fundamental Invariants (FI).

### Introduction to Invariant Polynomials (PIP) and Fundamental Invariants (FI)

#### Invariant Polynomials (PIP)

Permutation Invariant Polynomials (PIP) are a class of polynomials that remain invariant under molecular permutation transformations. In computational chemistry, PIP is mainly used to describe the relationship between molecular geometry and energy, especially playing an important role in potential energy surface fitting.

- **Core Features**: For any permutation of atoms in a molecule, the value of PIP remains unchanged, which allows it to capture the intrinsic structural features of the molecule without being affected by atom numbering.
- **Application Scenarios**: Mainly used in computational chemistry fields such as constructing molecular potential energy surfaces, reaction path analysis, and conformational search.
- **Advantages**: Compared to traditional coordinate representations, PIP provides a more compact and physically meaningful way to describe molecules, helping to improve computational efficiency and fitting accuracy.

#### Fundamental Invariants (FI)

Fundamental Invariants (FI) are algebraic generators that constitute invariant polynomials. They are a set of algebraically independent invariants that can generate all possible invariant polynomials through algebraic combinations (finite arbitrary addition and multiplication).

- **Definition**: FI is a minimal set of invariants such that any PIP can be expressed as a polynomial function of these FIs.
- **Calculation Method**: Usually calculated through group theory methods, considering the symmetry of molecules and irreducible representations of permutation groups.
- **Importance**: Choosing an appropriate FI set is crucial for building efficient and accurate potential energy surfaces, directly affecting computational efficiency and fitting quality.

#### Relationship between PIP and FI

PIP and FI are closely related concepts:

- FI is the foundation of PIP, and all PIP can be composed of FI
- Selecting an appropriate FI set can significantly reduce the number of terms to be considered, improving computational efficiency
- Together, they form a mathematical framework for describing the structure-energy relationship of molecules

#### Application in This Software

For existing PIP text, this software can convert it into corresponding polynomial evaluation code, supporting C/fortran languages. It can also convert a large amount of energy and configuration data represented as Cartesian coordinates into PIP polynomial input data.

## Installation Tutorial

This software is written in C++. Linux/Unix environments use g++ for compilation, while Windows environments use the MSVC toolchain.

### Environment Requirements

- **Linux/Unix**: g++ (supports C++03 standard)
- **Windows**: MSVC (cl.exe, link.exe, nmake)
- **Thread Support**: pthread library (needed when parallel backend is enabled)

### Windows Build (MSVC)

On Windows, use Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt to run build commands.

Recommended steps:

```cmd
cd /d d:\projs\FIanalyzer
nmake /nologo /f tools\Makefile.msvc
test\main.exe parameter\input.txt .\output\
```

Clean build artifacts:

```cmd
nmake /nologo /f tools\Makefile.msvc clean
```

You can also run the one-step script:

```cmd
build_run_test.bat
```

Note: If `nmake` or `cl.exe` is not found, you are not in Developer Command Prompt.

### Compilation Steps

1. **Clone or download the source code**
  Currently, open source links are available on both gitee and github
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/workspace
   git clone https://gitee.com/hao-yiping/FIanalyzer.git
   cd FIanalyzer
   ```

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/workspace
   git clone https://github.com/YipingHao/PIPFIanalyzer.git
   cd PIPFIanalyzer
   ```

2. **Run the installation script**
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

   By default, the installation script will compile with `-O2` optimization level.

3. **Optional compilation options**

   - **Specify optimization level** (0, 1, 2, 3):
     ```bash
     ./install.sh -o 3
     ```

   - **Enable debug information**:
     ```bash
     ./install.sh -g
     ```

   - **Combine optimization and debugging**:
     ```bash
     ./install.sh -g -o 1
     ```

   - **Clean compilation files and recompile**:
     ```bash
     ./install.sh -c
     ```

   - **Only clean compilation files**:
     ```bash
     ./install.sh -C
     ```

4. **Verify installation**

   After successful compilation, a `test.exe` executable file will be generated in the `test/` directory, and a `libFIanalyzer.a` static library file will be generated in the project root directory.

### Manual Compilation (Optional)

If manual compilation is needed, you can use the makefile in the tools directory:

```bash
cd tools
make
make test.exe
```

### Common Issues

- **Compilation errors**: Ensure that the g++ version supports C++11 (`SFI_v02` uses standard threads and scoped enums)
- **Linking errors**: Check if the pthread library is installed (usually installed by default on Linux systems)
- **Windows toolchain missing**: Ensure you run in Developer Command Prompt and `nmake`/`cl.exe` are available

## Usage Instructions

This software supports the following running modes: `dataswitch`, `CodeGeneration`, `cutoff`, `SFI`, `SFI_v02`, and `test`.

### Basic Running Method

Use the `run.sh` script to run the program:

```bash
./run.sh [options]
```

### Command Line Options

- `-i <input_file>`: Specify input parameter file (default: `./parameter/input.txt`)
- `-I <filename>`: Specify input parameter file (path is `./parameter/<filename>`)
- `-o <output_file>`: Specify output directory (default: `./output/`)
- `-g [gdb_options...]`: Run with gdb debugging
- `-h`: Display help information

### Parameter File Configuration

The parameter file uses a JSON-like format, with the main configuration items as follows:

```json
{
  PIPFileName = "./data/CH4.txt";          // PIP expression file path
  DataFileName = "./data/vain.txt";        // Data file path (required only for dataswitch)
  OutputFileName = "L-CH4";                // Output prefix (auto appends .txt/.c/.f90)
  threadCount = 32;                         // Thread count for dataswitch/SFI_v02

  item = "cutoff";                         // Modes: test/dataswitch/CodeGeneration/cutoff/SFI/SFI_v02

  CodeGenSetting =
  {
    CcodePrint = true;
    FortranCodePrint = true;
  };

  CutoffSetting =
  {
    threshold = "workload";                // order or workload
    order = 5;
    workload = 1000;
    CrossItem = true;
  };

  SFI =
  {
    order = 2;
    poly = 12;
    reciprocal = 12;
    exp = 12;
    gaussian = 12;
    cos = 12;
    sin = 12;
  };

    TestItem = {
        item = 3;                         // Test item number (only used in test mode)
    };
}
```

#### C-style Comments

The parameter file supports C-style comments, including single-line comments (`//`) and multi-line comments (`/* */`). For example:

```json
{
    PIPFileName = "./data/vain.txt";      // This is a single-line comment
    /* This is
       multi-line
       comment */
    DataFileName = "./data/O4.txt";
}
```

You can temporarily disable a parameter item by commenting it out, for example:

```json
{
   CcodePrint = true; 
   //CcodePrint = false; 
}
```
During runtime, the setting `CcodePrint = false` is commented out and will not generate C language code files.

#### Format Requirements

- All parameter items must end with a semicolon (`;`).
- Parameter item keys must be unique and cannot be repeated.
- Parameter item values can be strings, integers, floating-point numbers, or boolean values.
- Boolean values must be `true` or `false`, not other strings.
- Grouped parameters are accessed by dotted paths, e.g. `CodeGenSetting.CcodePrint` and `CutoffSetting.threshold`.

### Running Modes

#### Data Conversion Mode (item = "dataswitch")

This is the core mode of the software, used to convert bond length coordinate-energy data points into PIP polynomial data:

```bash
./run.sh -i ./parameter/input.txt -o ./output/
```
**How to enable this mode**:
- Set `item = "dataswitch"` in the parameter file

**Input files**:
- `PIPFileName`: PIP expression file path
- `DataFileName`: Bond length coordinate-energy data point file

**Input data format requirements**:
- Each line contains the same number of values (floating-point or integer)
- Values are separated by spaces
- Empty lines are supported (will be automatically ignored)
- Comments are supported (lines starting with `//` or `/* */`)
- There are two data formats:
  1. Only contains bond length coordinates: each line has `XCount` values
  2. Contains bond length coordinates and energy values: each line has `XCount + 1` values, with the last value being the energy value
  3. Any other column count is treated as an error
- `XCount` is inferred automatically as (maximum variable index in PIP expressions) + 1

**Output files**:
- `<OutputFileName>.txt`: Converted data file

**Output data format**:
- Each line contains `N + (E)` values, where `N` is the number of PIP polynomials, and `E` is the energy value (if input includes energy)
- If the input contains an energy column, the last output column keeps the original energy value
- Values use scientific notation format: `%25.16E`
- Return code convention: `0` success, `-1` input/output row mismatch, `-3` input column mismatch with `XCount`, `-4` output column mismatch with polynomial count

**Note**:
- The threading interface is only used at the data conversion entry
- For code generation, use the standalone `CodeGeneration` mode below

#### Code Generation Mode (item = "CodeGeneration")

This mode converts PIP expressions directly into C or Fortran code without data matrix conversion.

**How to enable this mode**:
- Set `item = "CodeGeneration"` in the parameter file

**Input files**:
- `PIPFileName`: PIP expression file path

**Output files**:
- `<OutputFileName>.c`: Generated C code (if `CodeGenSetting.CcodePrint = true`)
- `<OutputFileName>.f90`: Generated Fortran code (if `CodeGenSetting.FortranCodePrint = true`)

**Notes**:
- This mode does not require `DataFileName`
- `threadCount` has no practical effect in this mode

#### Polynomial Cutoff Mode (item = "cutoff")

This mode filters and truncates the input PIP expression set to generate a smaller expression file.

**How to enable this mode**:
- Set `item = "cutoff"` in the parameter file

**Input files**:
- `PIPFileName`: PIP expression file path

**Cutoff parameters (CutoffSetting)**:
- `threshold`: `"order"` or `"workload"`
- `order`: effective when `threshold` is `"order"`, meaning max kept order
- `workload`: effective when `threshold` is `"workload"`, meaning max accumulated workload
- In current implementation, workload is estimated cumulatively as `order × itemCount` per polynomial
- `CrossItem`: whether to enable cross-item filtering
- Current `CrossItem` rule checks repeated variable indices in the representative monomial; repeated indices are treated as non-`CrossItem`

**Output files**:
- `<OutputFileName>.txt`: truncated polynomial expression text (keeps original `P[i] = ...` format)

**Notes**:
- This mode does not perform data matrix conversion
- This mode currently does not trigger code generation
- `cutoff` rebuilds order distribution and partition information; output order may differ from input order

#### Fundamental Invariant Mode (item = "SFI")

This mode builds bond-length SFI features from `SFI.settings` and, with `SFI.DataSwitch = true`, writes a `<OutputFileName>.sfi.txt` data matrix.

Angle or dihedral FI input requires XYZ data and a separate FI file for each enabled feature type:

```text
UsingAngle = true;
AngleFileName = "./data/angle_FI.txt";
UsingDihedral = true;
DihedralFileName = "./data/dihedral_FI.txt";
SFI = {
  orderA = 1;
  settingsA = [{ cos = 2; }];
  orderD = 1;
  settingsD = [{ cos = 2; }];
};
```

`settingsA[i].cos = N` generates `cos(n*theta)` features (`n=1...N`) for angle FI expressions of order `i+1`. The implementation computes `x = cos(theta)` directly from XYZ coordinates and evaluates `T_n(x) = cos(n*theta)` with a first-kind Chebyshev recurrence, without evaluating `acos` or generating sine features. The old `settingsA[].sincos` key is no longer supported.

`settingsD[i].cos = N` generates `cos(n*phi)` features (`n=1...N`) for dihedral FI expressions of order `i+1`. The dihedral FI file should be generated by FIgenerator with only `Dihedral` enabled, so it uses local indices `r[0]...r[D-1]`. For N atoms, `D=N(N-1)(N-2)(N-3)/4`. Its local key is `(B,C,A,D)`, where `B<C` is the center edge and `A<D` is the endpoint pair; these two slots are not interchangeable.

The implementation obtains `cos(phi)` directly from the dot product of the two plane normals and uses the same Chebyshev recurrence, without a signed angle, `acos`, or sine features. If the center edge or either plane normal is degenerate, `cos(phi)=1` is used. With `UsingDihedral=true`, `DihedralFileName`, a positive `SFI.orderD`, and an equally sized non-empty `SFI.settingsD` array are required; at least one `settingsD[].cos` value must be positive.

The DataSwitch column order is fixed as bond SFI, angle cos-only SFI, dihedral cos-only SFI, then energy when present. C/Fortran code generation still contains bond-length SFI features only; angle and dihedral cosine features are limited to the DataSwitch matrix.

#### First-order Orthogonal Recurrence Mode (item = "SFI_v02")

`SFI_v02` is an XYZ-only data-conversion entry independent of the original `SFI` task. It consumes only first-order orbits from the bond, angle, and dihedral FI files. Bond lengths are nondimensionalized with element-pair covalent radii and then mapped with a rational, Morse, or Gaussian map; every geometry can use a Chebyshev or Legendre three-term recurrence. Each worker retains only the two adjacent recurrence orders and processes the trajectory in ordered chunks using standard threads.

It writes `<OutputFileName>.sfi_v02.txt` plus a machine-readable `<OutputFileName>.sfi_v02.columns.tsv`. The required `SFI_v02.channels` list controls block order explicitly, and energy is always the final data column. See the [SFI_v02 guide](docs/SFI_v02.md) and the runnable [sample configuration](parameter/input_sfi_v02.txt). Second-order bond FI, MAT input, gradients/forces, and code generation are not part of this version.

#### Test Mode (item = "test")

This mode is only for software developers to test functions:

Set `item = "test"` in a test parameter file, then run:

```bash
./run.sh -i ./parameter/your-test-input.txt -o ./output/
```

This is an internal test entry and is generally not required for end users.

### PIP Expression File Format

The PIP expression file contains multiple polynomial definitions, formatted as follows:

```
P[0] = r[0] + r[1] + r[2] + r[3] + r[4] + r[5];
P[1] = r[0] * r[1] + r[0] * r[2] + r[0] * r[3] + ...;
P[2] = r[0] * r[5] + r[1] * r[4] + r[2] * r[3];
...
```

Where:
- `P[i]`: The i-th PIP polynomial
- `r[j]`: The j-th variable (usually bond length or other geometric parameters)
- Parentheses can be used instead of square brackets to denote subscripts
- p and r can be replaced with any C language-supported variable names (identifiers)
- Supported operators: `+` (addition), `*` (multiplication)

### Multi-threaded Computing

The `threadCount` parameter is available to data-conversion tasks. The legacy `dataswitch` path may still fall back to a deterministic single-thread backend; `SFI_v02` uses cross-platform `std::thread` workers and caps them at the number of effective rows in the current chunk:

```json
threadCount = 32;  // Actual requested worker count in SFI_v02
```

### Usage Examples

**Data Conversion**

1. Prepare PIP expression file `my_pip.txt` and bond length coordinate-energy data point file
2. Create parameter file `my_input.txt`:
   ```json
   {
       PIPFileName = "./data/my_pip.txt";
       DataFileName = "./data/O4.txt";
       OutputFileName = "my_output";
       threadCount = 16;  // Use 16 threads for data conversion
       item = "dataswitch";  // Data conversion mode
   }
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./run.sh -I my_input.txt -o ./my_output/
   ```
4. Output files:
   - `./my_output/my_output.txt`: Converted data file

**Code Generation (standalone mode)**

1. Prepare a PIP expression file `my_pip.txt`
2. Create parameter file `my_codegen.txt`:
  ```json
  {
     PIPFileName = "./data/my_pip.txt";
     OutputFileName = "my_codegen";
     item = "CodeGeneration";
     CodeGenSetting = {
        CcodePrint = true;
        FortranCodePrint = true;
     };
  }
  ```
3. Run the program:
  ```bash
  ./run.sh -I my_codegen.txt -o ./my_output/
  ```
4. Output files:
  - `./my_output/my_codegen.c`: Generated C language code
  - `./my_output/my_codegen.f90`: Generated Fortran language code

### Debug Mode

Use gdb to debug the program:

```bash
./run.sh -g
```

You can also specify input and output files here:

```bash
./run.sh -g -i input_file -o  output_file
```

### Output File Description

- **Data conversion mode**:
  - `<OutputFileName>.txt`: Converted data file

- **Code generation mode**:
  - `<OutputFileName>.c`: Generated C language code (if `CodeGenSetting.CcodePrint = true`)
  - `<OutputFileName>.f90`: Generated Fortran language code (if `CodeGenSetting.FortranCodePrint = true`)

- **Polynomial cutoff mode**:
  - `<OutputFileName>.txt`: Truncated PIP expression text

- **Test mode**:
  - Test output files (only for developers)

### Notes

1. The key names in the parameter file (such as `PIPFileName`, `DataFileName`, etc.) must remain unchanged
2. String values need to be enclosed in double quotes
3. Ensure the input file path is correct
4. The output directory will be automatically created if it does not exist
5. In `SFI_v02`, `threadCount` is the actual requested worker count; legacy conversion paths may still use a deterministic single-thread backend

### Core Module Description

#### 1. Analyzer Module (analyzer.h/cpp)

This is the core module of the software, responsible for the representation and calculation of invariant polynomials.

**Main Classes**:

- **FIexpress**: Represents a single homogeneous polynomial
  - Stores the degree of the polynomial (order)
  - Stores the number of monomial terms (ItemCount)
  - Stores the variable indices of monomials (items)
  - Provides `compute_bare()` method to calculate polynomial values

- **FIexpresses**: Represents a collection of multiple polynomials

**Data Structure**:
```
Homogeneous polynomial storage format:
- Does not store constant terms, all terms have coefficients set to 1.0
- items array stores exponent information of monomials
- Size is ItemCount * order
- Each monomial occupies order elements, representing order independent variables
```

#### 2. Parser Module (parser.cpp)

Responsible for parsing PIP expression files and building polynomial objects.

**Main Functions**:
- Uses LR parser to parse PIP expressions
- Parses based on lexical and syntactic analysis tables (sheet.h)
- Converts text expressions into FIexpress objects
- Supports syntax error detection and reporting

**Parsing Process**:
```
PIP text → Lexical analysis → Syntactic analysis → Abstract syntax tree → FIexpress object
```

#### 3. Code Generator Module (printer.cpp)

Responsible for converting polynomial expressions into executable C or Fortran code.

**Main Functions**:
- `printCcode()`: Generates C language code
- `printFortrancode()`: Generates Fortran language code

**Generated Code Features**:
- Each polynomial uses independent temporary variables
- Each monomial is on a separate line to avoid excessively long single lines
- Uses double-precision floating-point numbers for calculations
- C code uses 0-based indexing, Fortran code uses 1-based indexing

#### 4. Multi-threaded Computing Module (analyzerthread.cpp)

Provides multi-threaded data conversion functionality to improve the efficiency of large-scale data processing.

**Main Functions**:
- Preserves the multi-thread compute interface and task partitioning logic
- In default build paths, thread parameters are used as a compatibility entry
- The current compute path prioritizes deterministic behavior and can fall back to single-thread compute

The strategy below describes allocation when a parallel backend is enabled.

**Thread Allocation Strategy**:
```
Total rows: rowi
Number of threads: threadCount
Each thread processes: rowsPerThread = rowi / threadCount
Remaining rows: remainingRows = rowi % threadCount
The first remainingRows threads each process 1 more row
```

### Thread Model

The software adopts a master-slave thread model:

```
Main thread
  ├─ Read parameter file
  ├─ Parse PIP expressions
  ├─ Create worker threads
  └─ Wait for all threads to complete
       │
Worker thread 1 ─┐
Worker thread 2 ─┼─ Parallel computing for data conversion
Worker thread N ─┘
```

### Compilation Products

The following files are generated after compilation:

- **libFIanalyzer.a**: Static library file containing all core functions
- **test/test.exe**: Executable program providing a command-line interface

### Extensibility Design

The software has good extensibility:

1. **Add new code generators**: Refer to printer.cpp to implement new print methods
2. **Support new syntax**: Modify lexical and syntactic rules in sheet.h
3. **Optimize computational performance**: Optimize the compute_bare method in analyzer.cpp
4. **Add new data types**: Add new Ktypes in dictionary.h

### Performance Optimization

- Uses row-major order storage to improve cache hit rate
- Supports multi-threaded parallel computing
- Avoids unnecessary memory allocation and copying
